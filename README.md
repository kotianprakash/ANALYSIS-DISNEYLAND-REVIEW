# Analysing Disneyland Reviews with NLP

# EDA, Word Clouds, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection, Collocation, Topic Modelling, Review classification

Though this NLP study, I wish to identify customer sentiment regarding Disney Land experience based on reviews by visitors. The reviews are from three locations of Disney Land at California, Paris, and Hong Kong.

I used textblob, vader, nltk, NRCLex, spacy, genism libraries in python to carry out sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and n-gram associations. I have also done topic modelling using which we can Identify visitor pain points and improve park experience.
